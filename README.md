# Printable Habit Tracker

Create a customizable, printable habit tracking grid inspired by GitHub's contribution heat map. This tool helps you visualize and maintain your daily habits, turning consistency into a visually satisfying experience.

For best results, I recommend printing in grayscale.

## Features

- Generate a year-long grid for tracking daily habits
- Print your personalized habit tracker for offline use
- Easily mark completed habits and watch your progress grow

Perfect for goal-setters, productivity enthusiasts, and anyone looking to build consistent habits through visual motivation.
